##Backend - https://github.com/Rahman2408/trash2cash-backend.git

##Objective -Provide a platform where one can keep track of items they need to sell and where they can sell them.

##Description -This app is called Trash-2-Cash where a user can keep track of all their items that they don't need and can see if maybe selling all of them might be worth the money. There are plenty of times when we decide we don't need one of our belongings but over time, those belongings add up and it's easy to forget all the things we mention we want to sell. Here not only can you track all the items you want to sell, but all the sites / platforms you use to sell your items!

##Instructions
Fork and clone both the frontend and backend repositories above.

For the backend: 

Run 'bundle install' in your terminal.

If you don't have postgresql installed, run 'brew install postgresql' in your terminal .

Start postgresql by running 'brew services start postgresql' in your terminal 

Run 'rails db:migrate' in your terminal migrate from ActiveRecord, create the data tables.

Lastly, run 'rails s' to start up the server that the frontend will use to communincate with the backend.

Whenenver finished, just press "ctrl + c" while in your terminal before exiting out and the server should stop.


For the frontend: 

Make sure you've completed the steps for the backend first.

In your terminal, run 'open index.html' and your browser should automatically load the app.
